## Bike Counts on Portland Bridges

In PSU's Data Science class for August 2018, we were supplied a dataset of daily bicycle counts on select bridges across the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. 

```{r table1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("table1.R")

outpu_df
```

The counts were distributed as viewed in this graph.

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("plot1.R")

count_plot
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
